The process of developing a data pipeline using Pandas and Scikit-learn in Python.

Steps Overview:
Data Collection
Data Cleaning and Preparation
Feature Engineering
Model Training and Evaluation
Model Deployment

Step-by-Step Guide-

# 1. Data Collection -
Collecting data from different sources (CSV, SQL, web scraping, etc.).

Data Pipeline Example

Here is a sample code snippet demonstrating how to read data from a CSV file using Pandas in Python:

python
import pandas as pd

 Example: Reading data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')** 


# 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation-
Cleaning the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, etc.

python
   Handling missing values
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
  Dropping duplicate rows
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

---

# 3. Feature Engineering-
Creating new features from the existing data to improve model performance.

python
 Example: Creating a new feature
data['new_feature'] = data['existing_feature'] ** 2

---
# 4. Model Training and Evaluation-
Using Scikit-learn to train and evaluate a machine learning model.

python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

  Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Training the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

Predicting and evaluating the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

---

# 5. Model Deployment-
Saving the trained model for future use.

python
import joblib

 Saving the model
joblib.dump(model, 'model.joblib')

 Loading the model (for future use)
loaded_model = joblib.load('model.joblib')

---

# Conclusion-
This pipeline involves data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and finally, deployment. You can adjust each step according to your specific use case and data.
